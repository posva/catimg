.SH DESCRIPTION
.B catimg
is a little program written in C with no dependencies that prints images in the terminal. It supports JPEG, PNG and GIF formats.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Coerce colors to a restricted palette. Allows terminals with limited color support to render a more accurate version of the image than if it was directly done by the terminal itself.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Prints a help message
.TP
\fB\-H\fR HEIGHT
Specify the height of the displayed image, passing '0' will use terminal height.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR HEIGHT_OFFSET
Specify the height offset of the displayed image, passing '0' will use no terminal height offset.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR LOOPS
Specify the amount of loops that catimg should repeat a GIF. A value of 1 means that the GIF will be displayed twice. A negative value implies infinity.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR RESOLUTION
Possible values 1 or 2. Force the resolution of the image. By default catimg will check if rendering in higher resolution is possible and do so or use the lower one.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
Disables true color (24-bit) support, falling back to 256 color escape codes instead.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR WIDTH
Specify the width of the displayed image. When not provided, catimg will use the terminal width.
